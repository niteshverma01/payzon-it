            Networking plays a crucial role in web hosting by ensuring seamless
            communication between servers, users, and the internet. A
            well-structured network enhances website performance, security, and
            reliability. Key networking components in web hosting include data
            centers, content delivery networks (CDNs), DNS, and load balancers,
            all of which contribute to efficient data transfer and uptime.
