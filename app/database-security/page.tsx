            Database security refers to the measures and strategies implemented
            to protect databases from unauthorized access, misuse, modification,
            or destruction. It encompasses a variety of practices aimed at
            safeguarding sensitive data stored within databases and ensuring
            that the data remains confidential, intact, and accessible only to
            authorized users. With the growing volume of cyber threats, database
            security has become a critical concern for organizations worldwide.
            The protection of personal information, financial records, and other
            sensitive data is essential for compliance, customer trust, and
            business integrity.

            Database security is a critical aspect of overall IT security, as
            databases store some of the most valuable and sensitive data for
            businesses. By implementing strong encryption, access control
            policies, regular patching, activity monitoring, and comprehensive
            backup and recovery plans, organizations can mitigate the risk of
            data breaches and ensure that their databases are protected. <br />
            Real-world examples from companies like Capital One, Yahoo, and
            Equifax highlight the importance of maintaining strong database
            security practices to prevent catastrophic consequences and protect
            both company and customer data.
